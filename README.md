# TuneToken Project

## Project Idea 
Our project envisions the creation of a cutting-edge music streaming platform that leverages Blockchain Technologies to ensure fair artist compensation, minimal fees, and unparalleled transparency. The integration of AI plays a pivotal role in addressing piracy and plagiarism, fostering a secure environment for artists. Successfully, we have developed our Minimum Viable Product, incorporating cryptocurrencies for music streaming sales within a user-friendly interface reminiscent of SoundCloud.

Our immediate post-MVP goals include refining the user interface and functionalities based on user feedback to provide a more satisfying and tailored experience. Additionally, we plan to integrate analytics to offer valuable insights.

In an ideal scenario with unlimited time, our priorities would extend to the development of advanced security measures and enhanced AI integration. These efforts are geared towards effectively combating issues related to piracy and music plagiarism, further solidifying our commitment to a secure and innovative music streaming platform.

We strongly believe that our platform holds significant market potential in a world that is increasingly devoid of excessive political involvement. This applies not only to so-called "lowkey" artists but also to renowned figures who are inclined to leverage our platform for monetization. Our comprehensive business model encompasses donations, commissions, and advertising strategies.

## Project Code 
To implement the decentralized music platform, we adopted a modular and organized approach to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clarity in the codebase. The code is divided into two main components: the smart contract written in Solidity and the frontend built using React. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
